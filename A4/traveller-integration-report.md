Subject: Traveller implementation from other team

Dear Manager,

Upon receiving the other team’s implementation of the Traveller interface, we thoroughly investigated it, and believe that their implementation was successful, and following the requirements given in the specification. The signature of the constructors and the methods on the class matched the signatures provided and the module accepts the described input formats. While the server implementation does expose additional details that were not outlined in the specification, this does not limit the functionality of the module. 

If we were to integrate their server implementation into our client code, it would be very easy to do so. The only changes to our current client implementation would be in replacing all instances of the placeholder class, ClientTownNetworkGarbagePlaceholder, with the server’s provided Traveller class. With that single adjustment, the client will work seamlessly with the server modules.

Upon reflection, it’s clear that we could’ve added more detail about error handling. Since we didn’t specify this information, the other team’s implementation didn’t explicitly handle errors that will inevitably be encountered in the program. In addition, future specifications will be sure to highlight implementation details that  would be crucial in making this program extensible (for example, creating a class to represent the character, rather than only using a string). Finally, future specifications will also emphasize the need to limit the surface area of an API and not expose implementation details or more functionality than explicitly required. In this case, that might help limit the scope of the interface to hide methods like getTown.  

Sincerely, 
Isabel Bolger and Lynnsey Martin
