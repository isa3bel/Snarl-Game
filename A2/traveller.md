Write a specification for the interface for a module, dubbed Traveller.

The module will plan a route through network of towns.
A town network is a simple graph specification + a placement of in-game characters.

The module must support these operations:
- the creation of a town network with named nodes;
- the placement of a named character in a town; and
- a query whether a specified character can reach a designated town without running into any other characters.

Specification in English with Java specific vocab as necessary.
